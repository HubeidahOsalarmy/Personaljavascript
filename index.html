        <h1>ISLAM AS A RELIGION</h1>
        <p>Islam is a religion of peace, unity and bliss. Anything other than goodness that the media associates with the islamic religion is nothing but lies.</p>
        <p>In Islam, we serve the only one true God who is Allah Azawajal. Our prophet (peace be upon him) is Muhammed (s.a.w), our holy book is Al-quran kareem</p>
        <p>For you to be regarded as a muslim, you have to believe in the oneness of Allah, believe in the prophet Muhammed (s.a.w) and other prophets sent by Allah azawajal, their holy books and the day of judgement.</p>
